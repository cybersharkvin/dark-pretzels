# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Grammar-Constrained Decoding (GCD) system using llama.cpp that enables strict control over LLM output format by restricting next-token choices to a formal grammar. The system will provide a Python + FastAPI pipeline that allows local LLaMA models to call Python "tools" (functions) in a reliable, structured way, similar to OpenAI's function calling interface but running entirely on local infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define Python functions as tools that an LLM can call, so that I can extend the model's capabilities with custom functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer defines a Python function with type hints and docstring THEN the system SHALL recognize it as a callable tool
2. WHEN a function includes a custom grammar specification in its docstring THEN the system SHALL use that grammar for the function call format
3. WHEN a function has optional parameters with defaults THEN the system SHALL handle optional arguments in the grammar
4. WHEN a function has typed parameters (str, int, float, bool) THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate grammar rules for each type

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically generate a combined GBNF grammar from all defined tools, so that the LLM output is strictly constrained to valid function calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple tools are defined THEN the system SHALL generate a single combined grammar covering all tool invocations
2. WHEN a tool has custom grammar in its docstring THEN the system SHALL incorporate that custom grammar into the combined grammar
3. WHEN no custom grammar is provided THEN the system SHALL auto-generate grammar rules based on function signatures and type hints
4. WHEN the grammar is generated THEN it SHALL include proper base type rules for strings, integers, floats, and booleans
5. WHEN the grammar is applied THEN the LLM SHALL only be able to output valid function calls matching the grammar

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want to load a llama.cpp model with grammar constraints, so that the model generates only structured outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL load the specified LLaMA model using llama-cpp-python
2. WHEN a grammar is provided THEN the system SHALL create a LlamaGrammar object from the grammar text
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the model SHALL use the grammar to constrain token choices
4. WHEN the model is prompted THEN it SHALL receive clear instructions about available tools and expected output format
5. WHEN temperature is set to 0.0 THEN the system SHALL produce deterministic, grammar-compliant outputs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want a FastAPI endpoint that processes user requests and returns tool execution results, so that I can interact with the LLM-powered tool system via HTTP.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a request to the FastAPI endpoint THEN the system SHALL process the request and generate an appropriate tool call
2. WHEN the LLM generates a tool call THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the output against the expected format
3. WHEN a valid tool call is parsed THEN the system SHALL execute the corresponding Python function with the provided arguments
4. WHEN a tool execution completes THEN the system SHALL return the result to the user via the API response
5. WHEN an error occurs during processing THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages and status codes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust parsing and validation of LLM outputs, so that only valid and safe function calls are executed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM produces output THEN the system SHALL parse it using Python's AST module for safety
2. WHEN parsing succeeds THEN the system SHALL extract the function name and arguments correctly
3. WHEN a function name is extracted THEN the system SHALL verify it exists in the tool registry
4. WHEN arguments are extracted THEN the system SHALL validate their count and types against the function signature
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate errors without executing the function
6. WHEN all validation passes THEN the system SHALL execute the tool function with the validated arguments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want proper error handling and fallback mechanisms, so that the system remains stable and provides meaningful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN grammar parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about the grammar issue
2. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL report the specific loading error and fail gracefully
3. WHEN LLM output parsing fails THEN the system SHALL return a structured error response
4. WHEN tool execution raises an exception THEN the system SHALL catch it and return an error response
5. WHEN invalid tool names or arguments are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and reject them safely
6. WHEN timeouts occur during model inference THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the system to be optimized for runtime efficiency, so that tool calls execute quickly and resource usage is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load the model and build grammars once at startup
2. WHEN multiple requests are processed THEN the system SHALL reuse the loaded model and grammar objects
3. WHEN concurrent requests arrive THEN the system SHALL handle them safely with appropriate thread management
4. WHEN grammar generation occurs THEN it SHALL only include type rules that are actually needed
5. WHEN model inference runs THEN it SHALL use appropriate context length and thread settings for the hardware

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper concurrency and thread safety controls, so that the system can handle multiple requests without crashes or performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple concurrent requests arrive THEN the system SHALL serialize access to the model to prevent race conditions
2. WHEN using llama-cpp-python THEN the system SHALL ensure thread-safe access since the model is not thread-safe by default
3. WHEN processing requests concurrently THEN the system SHALL use appropriate locking mechanisms (asyncio.Lock or queue)
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support running multiple model instances or processes
5. WHEN memory constraints exist THEN the system SHALL manage RAM/VRAM usage appropriately for the model size

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want robust input validation and security controls, so that the system cannot be exploited through malicious inputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing LLM output THEN the system SHALL use AST parsing instead of eval() to prevent code injection
2. WHEN validating function calls THEN the system SHALL verify function names exist in the known tool registry
3. WHEN processing tool arguments THEN the system SHALL validate argument types and counts against function signatures
4. WHEN executing tools THEN the system SHALL treat tool arguments as potentially untrusted user input
5. WHEN tools access external resources THEN they SHALL implement proper input sanitization and validation
6. WHEN using Pydantic validation THEN the system SHALL enforce additional constraints like email formats, value ranges, etc.

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive prompt engineering capabilities, so that the LLM understands how to use tools effectively.

5. WHEN API endpoints are unreachable THEN tools SHALL handle network failures gracefully
6. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL log events and return structured error responses

### Requirement 12
