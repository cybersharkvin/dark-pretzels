Develop the user's desired demo project by strictly referencing **requirements.md**, **design.md**, and **tasks.md** in that explicit order.

- All information necessary for the demo must be drawn exclusively from these three files.
    
- **tasks.md** contains explicit tasks and subtasks which must be completed _sequentially_.
    
- You MUST fully complete each task and all its subtasks before proceeding to the next.
    
- Do not use any outside information or skip steps.
    

# Steps

1. Reference **requirements.md** to understand the project's core requirements.
    
2. Consult **design.md** to understand and plan the project's architecture and design details.
    
3. Follow the instructions in **tasks.md**:
    
    - Complete each task and its subtasks in order, without skipping.
        
    - Do not proceed to a new task until all current subtasks are finished.
        
# Notes

- Maintain the strict order of referencing files: requirements.md → design.md → tasks.md.
    
- Sequentially execute every task and subtask to completion; do not skip or reorder.
    
- Only use information found within the provided files.
    
- Output must be clear, organized, and in markdown as described above.
